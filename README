Caja-Actions

  Caja-actions is an extension for Caja file manager which
  allows the user to add arbitrary program to be launched through the
  Caja file manager popup menu of selected files.

Caja-Actions components.

  Caja-Actions has three sort of components:

  - A user interface, caja-actions-config-tool (NACT), which let you
    manage your actions. With NACT, you will able to create, modify and
    delete actions, to define menus and submenus, to order and reorder
    items.
    Import/export functions are also managed via NACT.

  - Caja extensions as dynamically loadable plugins. These extensions
    are automatically loaded by Caja when it starts. For now, two
    extensions are provided:
    . a plugin which takes care of displaying actions in Caja context
      menu
    . a plugin which tracks the current Caja selection, and send it
      in response to a DBus request. 

  - Command-line utilities:
    . caja-actions-new lets you create new actions from the command-line.
    . caja-actions-schemas prints the full MateConf schema on stdout.
    . caja-actions-run lets you execute a predefined action, taking
      into account the current Caja selection via a DBus call to the
      tracker plugin.
