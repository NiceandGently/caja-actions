data/actions
------------
This directory contains some .desktop files as examples of actions or menus.
Actions cited in the Caja-Actions Configuration Tool user's manual are
in particular here.
There is some rather common actions which could be used as starting examples
by the user.

All actions in this directory are marked as 'disabled'. The packager is so
free to install them in XDG_DATA_DIRS/file-manager/actions without cluttering
the file manager itself.
