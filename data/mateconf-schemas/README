data/mateconf-schemas
------------------
This directory contains schemas to be installed in MateConf.

Note to translators.
--------------------
Only caja-actions-prefs-schemas.in may be translated in place.
Other files are automatically generated.
In particular, caja-actions-conf-schemas.in is generated from data
factory includes, and automatically takes into account translations
from po/ files.

Note to packagers.
------------------
Even if you choose to not actually install schemas in MateConf at install
time, we will find back them in prefix/share/caja-actions/mateconf-schemas/
subdirectory.
