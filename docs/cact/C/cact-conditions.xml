  <para>
    Whether your action will eventually be displayed in &caja; file manager
    context menus or in its toolbar depends on the conditions you will have
    defined for it.

    Conditions may be put against the location the file manager currently
    points to, or against the currently selected items in this location.
  </para>
  <para>
    Each time the selection or the location change in the file manager,
    &prodname; checks all your actions, comparing the defined conditions
    against the new location and selection: all defined conditions must
    be satisfied in order your action be actually displayed.
