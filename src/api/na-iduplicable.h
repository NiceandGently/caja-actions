/**
 * SECTION: na_iduplicable
 * @short_description: #NAIDuplicable interface.
 * @include: caja-actions/private/na-iduplicable.h
 *
 * This interface is implemented by #NAObject in order to let
 * #NAObject-derived instance duplication be easily tracked. This works
 * by keeping a pointer on the original object at duplication time, and
 * then only checking edition status when explicitely required.
 *
 * As the reference count of the original object is not incremented
 * here, the caller has to garantee itself that the original object
 * will stay in life at least as long as the duplicated one.
 *
 * Modification status in Caja-Actions configuration tool.
 *
 * - Objects whose origin is NULL are considered as modified ; this is
 *   in particular the case of new, pasted, imported and dropped
 *   objects.
 *
 * - when a new object, whether is is really new or it has been pasted,
 *   imported or dropped, is inserted somewhere in the tree, its
 *   immediate parent is also marked as modified.
 *
 * - Check for edition status, which positions modification and validity
 *   status, is not recursive ; it is the responsability of the
 *   implementation to check for edition status of childs of object..
