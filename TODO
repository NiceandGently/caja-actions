N-A BUGS
========
- 2011-11-15: an action with one profile - if the action has a property set to empty
  'folders=' and the profile does not have the property set, then set_defaults on the
  profile set the default property (here, 'folders=/') instead of taking the action
  value. On the UI, updating an action's property means updating the current profile.
  This is ok as long as the action is also set  (...) there is one profile and the
  action's property was not the default

- 2011-11-28 import assistant: intro label should be wrappable

- 2011-11-28 import assistant: importer ask format; long descriptions
  should be a long wrappable line

- 2011-11-28 have a padding (6) on top of gtkfilechooser (import & export assistants)
  not gtk3 : gtk2 only

- 2011-11-28 already existing item when importing should keep the same size
  between invocations
  2011-11-30 this is ok on f14 f16 ubu10 and almost on ubu11
  (ubu11): z-order is ok the first time, but comes back to the previous
  behavior starting with the second time (maybe a theme problem ?)

- 2011-12-06: after unsuccessfully tried to import via dnd:
   Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_tree_view_scroll_to_cell: assertion `tree_view->priv->tree != NULL' failed

Plan de test: NACT should be able to import all types of actions and menus,
kindly fixing small errors.
- for each and every released version, have an example of each available export format
  with lists of items and at least two profiles if feature is available

TODO
====
- 2011-02-21: implement startup mode

- 2011-02-21: implement execute as user

- 2010-06-17: implement shortcut button in NactIPropertiesTab page

- 2010-08-09: in v1.x until ??, %f used to be the basename!!

- 2010-12-30: gtk-doc 1.15
  "Use of uninitialized value within %DeclarationTypes in lc at /usr/bin/gtkdoc-mkdb line 929"
  when building XML

- 2011-02-07: is_level_zero_writable: should be monitored
  for now, is only evaluated when NAUpdater is instanciated

- 2011-02-07: are_preferences_locked: should be monitored
  for now, is only evaluated when NAUpdater is instanciated

- 2011-02-12: should we have a NAKeyFile shared between i/o-desktop and settings ?

- 2011-02-23: desktop environment
  accept a default at compile time
  accept as a runtime user preference (may be mandatory)

- 2011-06-08: when getting an elementary data, we should get the default value if it is not set
  to determine if a value is set, have a na_object_is_data_set (see na_object_item_deals_with_version)
  this should let us get ride of na_factory_object_set_defaults() function

- 2011-06-08: get ride of NADataBoxed ?

- 2011-11-29: exporter ask: add an option: do not import

  as in GtkFileChooser when selecting several files

N-A ENHANCEMENTS
================
- allow users to upload/download actions directly from a web repository
  (REST services ?)

- 2010-08-10: non-notification delay after save should be a preference

- 2010-08-09: na-pivot:st_burst_timeout should be a preference

- 2010-08-09: plugins should be able to provide a preference page

- 2010-09-30: export format and d&d format should be separated preferences

- 2010-06-17: ui enhancement
  all edition (entry, buttons, etc.) fields should have a small emblem when read-only.

- add a 'why this item is invalid'

- enhancement.ui: review toolbars layout
  so that detacheable toolbars do not take so such big extra space

- enhancement.management: we should be able to fully export a configuration
  this implies exporting menus and full tree
  + restore hierarchy on import (see bug 626337)

- enhancement.ui: rows implicitely selected should have a special display
  (as a sort of 'transparent' selection)

- enhancement.ui: review statusbar layout
  do not add extra height to statusbar
  better encapsulate statusbar, lock indicator, possibly other indicators

- enhancement.config: na_pivot_is_level_zero_writable:
  the provider which hosts the level-zero list of items should be a configuration option
  (current is MateConf)

- DBus service: list current I/O providers

- DBus service: import/export an action or a menu

- nact: new action assistant

- export: add a overwrite page: what to do if file already exists ?

- IActionTab: check_label has became useless since validity is global
  to the action - remove, or extend to each field which can led to
  unvalidity

- for each toolbar, let the user choose which buttons are displayed

- have a preference for modified and invalid fonts

- undo manager (at least Ctrl-Z)

- 2010-08-20: add an item in the context menu to explain why other actions
  are not displayed

- export-ask: the keep last choice check box should be as editable that export format

- 2011-05-20: should have an option to run in debug mode and dump whole configuration
  so that a user can click on a button, and then send a zipped log to the maintainer

- 2011-12-05: convert NAObject to GNode ?

OTHER ENHANCEMENTS
==================
- GOptions request enhancement so that the help for an option could be
  multiline (by defining an optional maximum width)

- MateConf Editor request enhancement: one should be able to refresh the hierarchy
  (F5 ?)

- Caja: implement menu separator for plugins

OTHER BUGS
==========
- 2011-02-21: caja: calls menu_provider_get_file_items() api each time we are
  activating a menu; as the call is made without any indication about the currently
  activated item, we have no other option than just recreate the menu; this is
  very expensive in computation time

- GLib bug for g_utf8_collate_key_for_filename()
  (see the 26 exported actions, and the screenshot of Caja view)

- Gtk bug: Caja doesn't display the actions in the order of the provided
  GList in its context menu (seems as if a cache would keep the actions which
  were already here the previous time - to be confirmed)

- Gtk bug: gtk_tree_path_up returns TRUE even if there is no parent
  cf. commit 5ee6938486cd82f1274969506873df950348dd61 and before
  function nact-tree-model.c::add_parent
  recreate a small code which reproduces this bug and open in bugzilla

- Caja bug when dnd to caja on other screen
  see https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=593453

- intltool: should implement standard targets for users
  (cf. 14.6 make.html GNU Make manual).
  As of 0.41.1, the absence of these standard targets prevents users
  (which are actually package developers) to provide any html, pdf, ...
  targets

- 2010-12-13: --enable-gtk-doc-pdf does not generate a pdf, but should

- 2011-02-23: it seems that Caja 2.30.1 calls get_file_items even when are 
  opening a submenu ?

- 2011-02-23: also it seems that Caja 2.30.1 free our menus (probably because 
  it is an item of its own menu), but not recursively the items of this menu.

NOTES
=====
- Note about the schemas in Caja Actions:
  a) actions are identified by uuid
  b) so, all MateConf keys have a path with the uuid of the action
  c) I'm not willing to write a schema for each and every uuid
  d) so, as of 1.11.2, the provided schema is general and should apply
     to all actions
  e) but there is not yet an API to set a MateConfMetaInfo for a key
     note that mateconftool-2 --dump is able to export for each entry a
     <schema_key> which includes the path to the general schema key
     but we cannot set it programatically (bad !)

- 20100408: mateconf_concat_dir_and_key: have seen this as deprecated, but do not
  find again the reference :(
  not even in unstable library on the web
  http://library.gnome.org/devel/mateconf/unstable/mateconf-mateconf.html#mateconf-concat-dir-and-key

- "x-caja-desktop:///" is rather a scheme than a folder => actually is an URI

- default has changed for schemes (was coded as 'file' instead of '*')
  when version is recorded (as 1.4.1 or 2.0) then schemes is reliable
  when version is not recorded, it is a 2.30 serie, and scheme is not recorded when default (i.e. file)
  do not try to force anything than that, but this will have to be documented
