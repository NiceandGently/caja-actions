- (Grumz) implement the Help button in nact (or hide it meanwhile)

- (Grumz) i18n doen't works in the command line tool and for some part
  of NACT like the scheme list, it seems..?

- Note about the schemas in Caja Actions:
  a) actions are identified by uuid
  b) so, all MateConf keys have a path with the uuid of the action
  c) I'm not willing to write a schema for each and every uuid
  d) so, as of 1.11.2, the provided schema is general and should apply
     to all actions
  e) but there is not yet an API to set a MateConfMetaInfo for a key
     note that mateconftool-2 --dump is able to export for each entry a
     <schema_key> which includes the path to the general schema key
     but we cannot set it programatically (bad !)

- allow users to upload/download actions directly from a web repository
  (REST services ?)

- changing conditions in IConditionsTab should trigger an update of the
  example label

- GOptions request enhancement so that the help for an option could be
  multiline (by defining an optional maximum width)

- GLib bug for g_utf8_collate_key_for_filename()
  (see the 26 exported actions, and the screenshot of Caja view)

- Gtk bug: Caja doesn't display the actions in the order of the provided
  GList in its context menu (seems as if a cache would keep the actions which
  were already here the previous time - to be confirmed)

- Gtk bug: gtk_tree_path_up returns TRUE even if there is no parent
  cf. commit 5ee6938486cd82f1274969506873df950348dd61 and before
  function nact-tree-model.c::add_parent
  recreate a small code which reproduces this bug and open in bugzilla

- MateConf Editor request enhancement: one should be able to refresh the hierarchy
  (F5 ?)

- for each toolbar, let the user choose which buttons are displayed

- when a unique app is found, use libwnck (?) to activate it

- have a preference for modified and invalid fonts

- undo manager (at least Ctrl-Z)

- IActionTab: check_label has became useless since validity is global
  to the action - remove, or extend to each field which can led to
  unvalidity

- export: add a overwrite page: what to do if file already exists ?

- caja-actions-new:
  give same defaults that when creating an action in NACT
  choose the target I/O provider

- Caja bug when dnd to caja on other screen
  see https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=593453

- nact: new action assistant

- DBus service: list current I/O providers

- DBus service: import/export an action or a menu

- optim: what about between base_builder_instance_init and
  base_application_v_initialize_default_icon ?

- enhancement.config: na_pivot_is_level_zero_writable:
  the provider which hosts the level-zero list of items should be a configuration option

- enhancement.ui: review statusbar layout
  do not add extra height to statusbar
  better encapsulate statusbar, lock indicator, possibly other indicators

- enhancement.ui: review toolbars layout
  so that detacheable toolbars do not take so such big extra space

- enhancement.management: we should be able to fully export a configuration
  this implies exporting menus and full tree
  + restore hierarchy on import

- enhancement.ui: rows implicitely selected should have a special display
  (as a sort of 'transparent' selection)

- nact-iactions-list.c: display_label
  the 'editable' cell property should be set only once, instead of at each redraw
  and more because we also compute this on selection change
  what we should do: compute once, and monitor to only change when needed

- Implement:
	Description
	SuggestedShortcut (see mate-keybinding-properties)
	Path
	ExecutionMode
	StartupNotify
	StartupWMClass
	ExecuteAs
	OnlyShowIn
	NotShowIn
	Hidden
	TryExec
	ShowIfRegistered
	ShowIfTrue
	ShowIfRunning
	SelectionCount
	Capabilities

- profile path and parameters should be set together as only one variable ?

- icon: is defined as localestring in desktop entry spec
  but path is defined as string in this same spec
  and icon may be a path -> so what to do with this ?

- in MateConf, for v3, have conditions in a subfolder
  configurations/
    id/
       properties/
       conditions/
       profiles/
          profile-un/
            properties/
            conditions/
            command/

- 20100408: mateconf_concat_dir_and_key: have seen this as deprecated, but do not
  find again the reference :(
  not even in unstable library on the web
  http://library.gnome.org/devel/mateconf/unstable/mateconf-mateconf.html#mateconf-concat-dir-and-key

- "x-caja-desktop:///" is rather a scheme than a folder

- enhancement.ui: add a 'why this item is invalid'
